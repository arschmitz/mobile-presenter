<h1>WHATS LEFT?</h1>
<--Notes-->
<p>So at this point you have heard me talk about a lot of code moving to UI and how all of ui will be pulled into mobile. And from the table on previous widget slide you see there are only a small number of widgets remaining in mobile. So whats left exactly? Mobile well be a layer on top of jQuery ui adding in additional functionality and widgets based around simplified app development</p>
