<--Notes-->
<p>A few weeks later i was speaking at jQuery Europe</p>
<p>We had another patch release ready to go by this time fixing a few critical bugs</p>
<p>One release fail in a month was just not good enough for me</p>
<p>And neither was one live demo in a single talk</p>
<p>Prior to Europe i had been using a keynote with a custom theme made to look like jQuery Mobile</p>
<p>But many of my teammates and people in the audience when they asked about my slides were suprised it was not actually jQuery Mobile and asked why i didnt just use JQM</p>
<p>I didnt have a great excuse and in the weeks inbetween i rebuilt to use the setup you see today complete with the follow feature i mentioned before</p>
<p>So in vienna i had a lot on the line Another live release, unvailing of my new presentation deck and follow along feature.</p>
<p>I checked and prepared 100 times i was the second talk of the day so there would be no time in the morning</p>
<p>2AM the night before i run through the whole talk including the release and everything goes perfectly even on terrible hotel wifi</p>
<p>The one thing i could not count on was npm...</p>
