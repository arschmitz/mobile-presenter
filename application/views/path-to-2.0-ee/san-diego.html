<--Notes-->
<p>Back in February I decided to try a live demo for the first time at jQuery San Diego. I knew it was probably a bad idea, and i knew it was likely to fail, but i decided ( with the urging to my team ) to throw caution to the wind and go for it</p>
<p>But this was not going to be just any live demo, we were going to attempt to release a new version live on stage during my talk about mobile performance</p>
<p>I Took the stage excited and nervous for how the attempt would turn out</p>
<p>I didn't have to wait long to find out though.</p>
