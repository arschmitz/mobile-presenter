<--Notes-->
<p>Both projects also standardized on using bower for managing external dependencies</p>
<p>The combination of a shared build system, amd, bower, and require js, means its very simple to include files from one repo to another for example pulling widgets from ui repo into the mobile repo in a sane and managable way.</p>
<p>This is important as the projects move forward and share an increasing amount of code</p>
