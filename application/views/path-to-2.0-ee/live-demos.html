<h1>LIVE DEMOS === BAD IDEA</h1>

<--Notes-->
<p>So now its time for some demos of what you will see coming in UI 1.12 and Mobile 1.5</p>
<p>Live demos are always kind of a tricky thing at conferences they have a horrible tendency of going wrong.</p>
<p>I have seen a lot of them attempted and they are far too often a bad idea only moments in</p>
<p>I bet more then a few of you here have seen a few hiccups at WWDC or similar events where apple even though they spend incredible amounts of money testing and preparing, still don't have all their demos go off without a hitch. Fate always still seems to way of catching up and throwing a  wrench in the works</p>
<p>But at the same time live demos are exciting</p>
